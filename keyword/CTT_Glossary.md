# Constructive Tensor Theory - Glossary

### pullback
The process of defining a tensorial quantity from a base manifold to an observer manifold, preserving semantic or physical interpretation.

### observer manifold
A structured space that defines the frame or context from which measurements or meanings are derived.

### constructive tensor
A tensor that is defined not just by components, but by the constructive process through which it emerges from pullback hierarchies.

### frame inconsistency
A condition where different observer frames yield non-commutative or conflicting measurements, necessitating a pullback resolution.

### semantic geometry
The geometric structure arising from meaning-based relationships, as encoded through pullback mappings.

### constitutive ontology
A redefinition of existence through the ability to be constructed via pullback structures.

### recursive observer
An observer whose frame is defined through iterative pullback mappings, allowing a model of consciousness or self-reference.

### constructive epistemology
The theory of knowledge acquisition grounded in the geometric pullback from phenomena to observer frames.

### semantic consistency
The requirement that meaning remains coherent across observer-based mappings in time or across structures.

### entropy (constructive)
A measure of pullback irreversibility, encoding directionality of time and observation.
