    <h1>Constructive Tensor Theory (CTT) and Its Distinction from Existing Theories</h1>
    <p>This page summarizes the key differences between Constructive Tensor Theory (CTT) and various established frameworks in physics, mathematics, and philosophy. A downloadable PDF report is available below.</p>
